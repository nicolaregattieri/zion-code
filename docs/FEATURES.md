## Known Edge Case (Revisit)

| Topic | Current Behavior | Follow-up |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Stash transfer on same file/line across worktrees | Git may block `stash apply` with local-overwrite errors and no unmerged (`-U`) files. In this path, Zion shows support/recovery flow instead of opening conflict resolver. | Add deterministic same-file transfer strategy so users can resolve this case with less manual stash juggling. |
